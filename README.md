### Belly Button Biodiversity

Gross but intriguing is a great way to describe this assignment. I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset used reveals a small handful of microbial species, called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, that were present in more than 70% of people. 

Using a dropdown which lists the sampled individuals, the dashboard will show the following for the selected individual:
* The demographic information
* A horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs and values
* A bubble chart to display each smaple and values 
* A gauge that shows how often belly button washing occurs weekly
